# Visually Impaired Banking Service Agent Transformer Assitant
VISTA is an intelligent voice assistant designed to empower visually impaired banking service agents by streamlining customer interactions. Built with a Transformer-based NLP model, it supports speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and a seamless chat interface to enable efficient and accessible banking support. The system integrates a Flask backend with a modern, accessible frontend, providing features like secure login, real-time chat, and intelligent query handling.

## Problem Statement
Transformer Based Help Desk for Visually Impaired Service Agents with voice assistance integrated project aims to design and implement a transformer based AI system developed from scratch that enables visually impaired bank representatives to handle customer queries efficiently. The system will process input queries, classify them into standardized categories, translate responses into local languages, and convert them into speech for the representative to communicate. It focuses on empowering visually impaired bank agent/representative to provide accurate, timely responses using advanced transformer-based models.

## Solution 
We built VISTA (Visually Impaired Banking Service Agents Transformer Assistant), an accessibility-focused help desk platform designed to empower visually impaired banking service agents. VISTA leverages Transformer-based NLP models for query understanding and classification, multi-language translation, and integrates Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries for seamless voice communication.

The system features a Flask backend with secure API endpoints and a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for accessibility and screen reader support. It enables real-time communication, automates routine workflows, and delivers accurate, context-aware responses while maintaining data security.By combining Python-based AI models, STT/TTS capabilities, and an accessible UI, VISTA reduces manual effort, enhances efficiency, and provides inclusive, AI-driven banking support for visually impaired service agents.
